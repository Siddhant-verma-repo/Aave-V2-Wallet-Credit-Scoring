## 🧠 High-Scoring Wallets (900–1000)

- **Total Wallets:** 3418
- **Average Score:** 994.95
- **Characteristics:**
  - High repayment-to-borrow ratios (>90%)
  - Very low or no liquidation events
  - Strong preference for deposit-first behavior
  - Healthy borrow-to-deposit ratios
  - Regular and human-like interaction intervals

✅ These wallets represent responsible users who interact safely and sustainably with the Aave V2 protocol.

---

## ⚠️ Low-Scoring Wallets (≤300)

- **Total Wallets:** 0  
- No wallets in the current dataset scored in this range.

💡 This suggests the dataset is heavily skewed toward reliable users. In future iterations, you may:
- Introduce known bot/exploit wallets
- Include edge cases (e.g., users who defaulted or were frequently liquidated)

---

## 🔍 Notes & Observations

- The distribution is top-heavy: **96%+** of wallets scored above 900.
- Scoring criteria may need **tightening or normalization** to reflect greater behavioral diversity.
- There is **sparse representation** in the 600–899 range — potential area to refine rules.
